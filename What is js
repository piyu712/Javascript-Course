JavaScript is a single-threaded language which means it executes one task at a time.

Key Features of JavaScript
Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript runs on the userâ€™s browser, so has a faster response time without needing to communicate with the server.
Versatile: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex server-side applications.
Event-Driven: JavaScript can respond to user actions (clicks, keystrokes) in real-time.
Asynchronous: JavaScript can handle tasks like fetching data from servers without freezing the user interface.
Rich Ecosystem: There are numerous libraries and frameworks built on JavaScript, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which make development faster and more efficient.
